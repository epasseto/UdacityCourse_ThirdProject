### Modules description

The project . And the files are listed below.

`udacourse2.py` → Python 3 code, as a library of useful functions for both parts of the project

#### additional files

`ETL Pipeline Testing.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for calling and testing `process_data.py` functions

### additional data sources

`messages.csv` → file containing the original raw data to be processed (input: later it will be converted in our X-data, messages for training) 

#### additional files 

`ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook documenting all the steps for building the Machine Learning Pipeline

`ML Pipeline Condensing.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for condensation of all the steps from `ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb`, in order to turn it into useful functions

`ML Pipeline Testing.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for calling and testing `train_classifier.py` functions
